        <p>The Sopranos were created in 2001 by Evan Scalzo, a former G-Men and Men's Glee Club Member. His idea behind the Sopranos was to have an all-women acapella group that was open to all women at the University, free of affiliation from other choral groups. The Sopranos is a member of the Michigan A Cappella Council (MACC), along with 15 other groups on campus. 

            MACFest 2001 was the first event at which The Sopranos sang. Since then, The Sopranos have been kicking ass and taking names all around the state. In addition to performing at UMich, The Sopranos also perform on other college campuses around the state including Central Michigan University and Michigan State University. The Sopranos also competed for their first time in the ICCA's Quarter Finals in Ann Arbor Michigan in 2016. When they returned to compete in the ICCA's Quarter Finals in 2017, they were honored to receive the award for Best Arrangement (for the entire set)! 
            
            The Sopranos most recently released a brand new EP, "S" on Spotify and Apple Music. The Sopranos released their first CD, Mob Ties, in the summer of 2005 and their second CD, An Offer You Can't Refuse, in the spring of 2011.  </p>
